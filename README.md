# Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition with scikit-learn and TensorFlow 

By his we learn how machine learning can be applied to computer vision projects, using a couple of different Python modules. I also created and trained a support vector machine that actually performed digit classification.

Steps:
1)Acquiring and processing MNIST digit data
2)Creating and training a support vector machine
3)Applying the support vector machine to new data
4)Introducing TensorFlow with digit classification
5)Evaluating the results
